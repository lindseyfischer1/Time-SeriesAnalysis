The dataset contains two main variables: observation_date and LRHUTTTTITM156S. The observation_date represents the specific month and year when the unemployment rate was recorded, formatted as YYYY-MM-DD, ranging from January 1, 2010, to November 1, 2024. This variable serves as the time dimension of the dataset and is recorded at a monthly frequency.

The unemployment_rate (%) variable represents the unemployment rate in Italy, measured as a percentage. It indicates the proportion of the labor force that is unemployed and actively seeking work. The values range from 0 to 100 percent and are recorded on a monthly basis from January 2010 to November 2024. Synonyms for this variable include 'Jobless Rate' and 'Employment Rate'.

The data is sourced from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) repository and is compiled and maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, using statistics from Italyâ€™s national statistical agency (Istat). The unemployment rate is calculated based on labor force surveys conducted by Istat, following international labor market definitions established by organizations such as the International Labour Organization (ILO). The dataset is updated monthly and may be subject to periodic revisions to reflect methodological improvements and revised labor statistics.

I chose this dataset because I spent my last semester studying abroad in Rome, Italy. After living there for four months, I became super interested and involved in learning more about Italian culture and ways of living. Now I want to be able to apply my data analyzing skills to a culture I enjoy learning more about. I think it will be interesting to see comparing Italy's unemployment rate's to America's if I ever have the opportunity as well.
